Inspired from https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-projects-for-beginners

The goal here is to implement machine learning algorithms on sample data, and create implementations for some of the mathematical and statistical concepts used in machine learning.

The goal of this repository is to effectively be a guide and/or a stepping stone for future machine learning projects.
